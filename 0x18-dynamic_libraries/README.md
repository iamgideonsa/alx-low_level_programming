# 0x18. C - Dynamic libraries

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to know about dynamic and shared libraries in **C Language**.

## Apparatus
* Used `vi` as editor
* All files compiled & tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc (using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89) for C files
* Used Betty style for C

## Files
All files are scripts and programs written in C Language:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `libholberton.s` | Dynamic library that contains many functions |
| `1-create_dynamic_lib.sh` | Shell script that creates a dynamic library |
| `100-operations.so` | Dynamic library that contains mathematical functions |
| `101-make_me_win.sh` | Shell script that injects a C program in order to hack `gm` executable file |
