# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to be able to explain to anyone, **without the help of Google**:
* What is a search algorithm
* What is a linear search
* What is a binary search
* What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Tech
* Used editors: `vi`, `vim`, and `emacs`
* All files are compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* All files end with a new line
* There is a README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
* Code uses the `Betty` style and it is checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
* No global variables used
* No more than 5 functions per file
* Only the `printf` function of the standard library was used
* The `main.c` files are examples and can be used to test functions
* The prototypes of all functions are included in the header file called `search_algos.h`
* All header files include guarded
