# 0x1A. C - Hash tables

This project was done during **ALX SE Studies** at **ALX School**. The end game is to learn how to implement Hash Tables with **C language**.

## Apparatus
* Used `vi` as editor
* All files compiled & tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
* Used Betty style for C

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `0-hash_table_create.c` | Function that creates a hash table |
| `1-djb2.c` | Function that executes the djb2 algorithm |
| `2-key_index.c` | Function that returns the index of a key |
| `3-hash_table.c` | Function that adds an element to the hash table |
| `4-hash_table_get.c` | Function that retrieves a value associated with a key |
| `5-hash_table_print.c` | Function that prints a hash table |
